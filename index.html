        <p>
            In a heartwarming start to the New Year, New Zealand has welcomed its first baby of 2025. Baby Alf was born just one minute past midnight at Auckland City Hospital, weighing a healthy 3.4 kilograms (7.5 pounds). He measured 52 centimeters (20.5 inches) in length, with a head circumference of 35 centimeters (13.8 inches).

            According to the attending doctors, Alf's weight is considered perfectly within the healthy range for a newborn. His skin had a natural rosy glow, and his first cries were described as strong and full of life.

            Proud parents, Emma and Liam, expressed their overwhelming joy and gratitude, calling Alf their "perfect New Year gift." Emma mentioned that the labor lasted approximately six hours and went smoothly thanks to the excellent care provided by the hospital staff. Liam added, "He's already showing signs of being a strong and curious little guy."

            The hospital staff celebrated alongside the family, marking this special occasion with smiles and warm wishes. The delivery team included Dr. Sarah Patel and Nurse Rachel Williams, who both shared their joy in being part of such a memorable event.

            Alf's first outfit was a cozy white onesie with a tiny embroidered kiwi bird on the chest, symbolizing his proud New Zealand heritage. He was wrapped in a soft, hand-knitted blanket gifted by a volunteer group from the hospital.

            As one of the first countries to greet the New Year, New Zealand is proud to introduce Baby Alf to the world as the very first newborn of 2025. Local community groups and well-wishers have already begun sending messages of love and support to the family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Baby Alf has already become a symbol of hope, joy, and new beginnings for the people of New Zealand and beyond. The family plans to hold a small celebration at home once they are discharged from the hospital.
